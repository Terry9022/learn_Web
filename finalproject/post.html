				<div id="post-cotent-inside"><p>In this article/video, I will talk about few things you need to know before coming to UAlbany. After applying for UAlbany, if you just thought you finished all the tiring process, then you are wrong. There are more things waiting for you to do such as applying for the US visa, choosing the courses, deciding the housing, etc. Back to the time before I arrive UAlbany, I wish I could have found one article telling me all details about this. Unfortunately, I didn’t, so I made some detour. Therefore, I hope this article can make thing clear for you and help you make the right decision for your exchange student journey. </p>

					<p>In this article/video, I want to show you what the life at UAlbany would be like, and I will take myself for example to show you my life at UAlbany. I will stay in UAlbany for one year, and I won’t go back to Taiwan during the winter vacation, which is a great chance for me to travel in US. I have not been to US and Canada before, so I am excited about it. On fall break, I already went to Miami. Let’s take a look of my life here. I will also give you some tips about after arriving Albany including the telephone, bank account, and what are the options for you to engage in school life. </p>
