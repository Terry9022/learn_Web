            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am an exchange student from National Taiwan University, and I will study at UAlbany in the academic year of 2021/22. The international student office in my home university requires all the exchange students to provide the documentary report as a reference for any student in my university who might want to be an exchange student to that school in the future. In the past time, other exchange students wrote the articles and submitted them to the school, and the staff in school posted these articles on the school website. However, the article about a specific school is hard to be found on the webpage since there are too many articles on that page. Besides, it is also difficult to contact the author after reading that documentary report if the viewer wants to ask any further questions, not to mention some students just hand in some texts without the useful information due to duty. Therefore, I want to make the life of an exchange student in UAlbany a website, and I can put my personal thoughts about exchange students and useful information about the University at Albany on the page. The content can include articles and videos. They can cover several necessary topics for students who just come to UAlbany or who is still deciding whether he or she should choose UAlbany as the destination. The website could be important and useful for these students because there are a lot of things they need to know. They will face the process of applying to the school, and they might want to know the pros and cons of choosing UAlbany, what life here would be like, and some administrative information such as academics, finances, and housing, and so on. Last, it would be also great for me to record my life in UAlbany and share it with others through my website.</p>
